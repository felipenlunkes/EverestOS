This file is a list of example input items for mpart.exe along
with a description of how to create your own.

Instructions:
 1. A line may contain a '#' character as the character to indicate
    that any remaining characters in this line are used as a comment.
 2. A line must start with one of the following items:
    out:
    mbr:
    part:
    <blank space>
    # <comment goes here
 3. All spaces and tabs are ignored, including any spaces within
    filenames.  Therefore, you may not use a filename that includes
    a space character.
 4. Even though each extended partition uses a relative offset to
    its parent, the base= parameter *must* be a physical lba offset
    from the start of the disk, not a relative offset from its 
    parent partition.
 5. Extended partitions may be nested within each other.
 6. You may have unlimited extended partitions (up to the amount
    currently coded in the source file (64) and of course, size
    of image file produced.)
 7. This utility does not check for out-of-bounds or overlapped
    partitions.
 8. Only 4 partition entries are allowed per partition record.
 9. All numbers are in decimal.

Very few errors are checked.  It is up to the user to make sure
that all parameters are correct, images fit within the size given,
etc.  I did not make this utility to show how to find errors.  I
made this utility to show how to make partitions.


Explanation of parameters:
 1. out:
    This is an optional parameter.  You do not have to include
    the out: parameter in your source.  If you do not, the target
    image file created is retrieved from the command line or defaults
    to "outfile.img".  However, if you do use this parameter, you must
    use the file= sub-parameter.

      file="filename.bin"
        This is a path and filename to the image file that will be created.
      spt=63
        This is the number of sectors per track used for this image/disk.
        This parameter is optional and defaults to 63 if not used.
      heads=16
        This is the number of heads (sides) used for this image/disk.
        This parameter is optional and defaults to 16 if not used.

 2. mbr:
    This is an optional parameter.  This parameter is used to indicate
    what 512 byte image to write to the 1st sector of the image.  The
    partition entries with in this image will be over written by the
    part: parameters.  All four will be zeroed first, then overwritten.
    If you use this parameter, you must use the file= sub-parameter.

      file="filename.bin"
        This is a path and filename to the image file that will be written
        to the first sector of the disk.

 3. part:
    This is a required parameter.  At least one is required, though no checks
    are made.  This is the parameter that indicates what type and size of partition
    to create.

      file="filename.bin"
        This is a path and filename to the image file that will be written
        to the partition at this base.  No check is made to see if the image
        file is larger that the partition size given.  The utility will pad
        the ending sectors with zeros if the image file is smaller than the
        size given.  This parameter is optional and may be omitted or used as:
          file=""
        If no filename is given, or this parameter is omitted, this utility
        will write zeros to the sectors within this partition.  This parameter
        is ignored if this line is an extended partition.

     base=
        This parameter is required.  It is the base lba from the start of the
        disk, not the relative offset from the parent partition this partition
        resides in (if a partition within an extended partition).  This is so
        you don't have to calculate the relative offsets.  Remember that all
        values are in decimal format and can not be larger than 32 bits.

      size=
        This parameter is required.  It is the number of sectors in this partition.
        This number must be decimal and no more than 32 bits in size.

      type=
        This parameter is required.  It is the type of partition.  This number
        must be decimal and no more than 8 bits in size.  If this value is
        5 (five) or 15 (fifteen), this utility will create an extended partition
        at this base lba.

      active=
        This parameter is optional and zero (0) is default if not given.
        This indicates that this utility should mark this partition active.

      last=
        This parameter is optional and zero (0) is default if not given.
        *However*, undefined results including crashing may result if you do
        not use this parameter correctly.  This parameter indicates that this
        is the last partition within this partition record.  In other words,
        if this is a partition within an extended partition, go back to the
        last one (the parent partition) and continue with it.  Remember, if
        this is an extended partition entry, even though there may be multiple
        entries after this entry within these extended partition entry(ies),
        if this is the last entry in this partition record, you still need
        to specify that this is the last one (last = 1).  Please see the 
        examples below about using the last=1 sub-parameter.
        
** Please remember that no checks are made for accuracy.  It is up to the
   user to make sure that partitions are correctly spaced, sized, typed,
   and do not overlap.

# Example 1

#   command line and assuming the default 63 SPT and 16 heads.  No MBR image.
